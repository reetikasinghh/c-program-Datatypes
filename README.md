# c-program-Datatypes
Program Aim:
The aim of this program is to demonstrate the declaration and use of different data types in C++, including integers, floating-point numbers, double-precision floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. It prompts the user to input values for these data types and then displays the entered values.

Program Theory:

#include<iostream>: This line includes the necessary header file <iostream> to enable input and output operations in the program.

int main(): This is the entry point of the program. All C++ programs start execution from the main function.

using namespace std;: This line allows us to use the standard C++ library (std) without explicitly specifying it in the code. It simplifies the code by eliminating the need to prefix elements from the standard library with "std::".

Declaration of variables:

int myintvar;: Declares an integer variable to store whole numbers.
float myfloatvar;: Declares a float variable to store numbers with decimals.
double mydoublevar;: Declares a double variable to store larger numbers with decimals.
char mycharvar;: Declares a character variable to store single letters or symbols.
bool myboolvar;: Declares a boolean variable to store true or false values.
cout and cin statements: These statements are used to display prompts to the user and read values from the user for each variable.

Displaying the entered values: After reading values from the user, the program displays the entered values for each data type using cout.

return 0;: This statement indicates the successful termination of the program with a return value of 0.

Program Algorithm:

Declare variables for each data type: integer, float, double, character, and boolean.
Prompt the user to enter values for each data type.
Read the user's input for each variable.
Display the entered values for each data type.
Program Conclusion:
This C++ program demonstrates the declaration and use of various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, double-precision floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. It prompts the user to enter values for each data type and then displays the entered values. This program serves as a basic introduction to data types and input/output operations in C++.
